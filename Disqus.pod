=head1  Disqus API Keys


There are two types of API keys:

=head2 User API Key

Unique to each Disqus account.
If a user is logged in they can find their C<user_api_key> by visiting L<http://disqus.com/api/get_my_key/>. You need to keep this key safe.

=head2 Forum API Key

Each Forum(site) has a C<forum_api_key>. The creator of a forum can get their key using the C<get_forum_api_key> method call. This should be stored in a config file which is well protected.
